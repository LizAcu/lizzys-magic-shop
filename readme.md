**User Story**

This is an app for a magic shop! Anybody can view our items, but in order to submit a suggestion or edit items, one must have an account. 


**Technologies used**

This full CRUD web application was created using mongoDB API, working with different npm packages and modules. I worked with Nodejs, Mongoose, Express, and EJS. CSS was used to style the different routes, bcrypt npm package was used to work with users and aid in keeping passwords secure (encrypted) when the user types in. 

**Thoughts**

One feature that I would have liked to have that I am going to look into is having music playing on the pages.
I also wanted to include a feature where only users can add an item to their "list of favorites".
