**Technologies used**

This web application was created using mongoDB API, working with different npm packages and modules. I worked with Nodejs, Mongoose, Express, and EJS. CSS was used to style the different routes, bcrypt npm package was used to work with users and aid in keeping passwords secure (encrypted) when the user types in. 

**Thoughts**

One feature that I would have liked to have that I am going to look into is having music playing on the pages.
